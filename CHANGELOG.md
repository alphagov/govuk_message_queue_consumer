# Changelog

## Unreleased

* Add explicit gem dependency for `ostruct` gem (extracted from stdlib into a gem from Ruby 3.5.0)
  ([#131](https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_message_queue_consumer/pull/131))

## 5.0.1

* Add explicit require for `ostruct` library to `MockMessage` (previously relied on `ostruct` being
  required somewhere in consuming code)

## 5.0.0

* BREAKING: remove disused support for statsd. No clients in alphagov use the statsd functionality any more, so this is only theoretically breaking.
* Allow clients to specify a Bunny worker thread pool size of greater than 1. The default behaviour remains unchanged.
* Allow clients to specify "client prefetch" to allow more than one unacked message on a channel at a time. The default behaviour remains unchanged.
* Clean up some disused remnants of the batch consumer feature. The feature was removed in 4.0.0.

## 4.2.0

* Drop support for Ruby 3.0. The minimum required Ruby version is now 3.1.4.
* Add support for Ruby 3.3.
* Drop support for Ruby 2.7.
* Fix ability to handle system signals, and report non-`SIGTERM` errors to `GovukError`

## 4.1.0

* Support configuration via
  [`RABBITMQ_URL`](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny/blob/066496d8/docs/guides/connecting.md#the-rabbitmq_url-environment-variable)
  instead of `RABBITMQ_HOSTS`, `RABBITMQ_VHOST`, `RABBITMQ_USER` and
  `RABBITMQ_PASSWORD`, which are deprecated and will be removed in a later
  version.
* Update [bunny](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny/) from 2.11 to 2.17, which
  is the last version that supports Ruby 2.7. See [Bunny
  changelog](https://github.com/ruby-amqp/bunny/blob/main/ChangeLog.md#changes-between-bunny-216x-and-2170-sep-11th-2020).
